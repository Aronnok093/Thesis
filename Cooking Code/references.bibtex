Each phenotype and gene is given a separate entry assigned a stable, unique identifier. The entries contain structured summaries of new and important information based on expert review of the biomedical literature. OMIM.org provides interactive access to the knowledge repository, including genomic coordinate searches of the gene map, views of genetic heterogeneity of phenotypes in Phenotypic Series, and side-by-side comparisons of clinical synopses. OMIM.org also supports computational queries via a robust API. All entries have extensive targeted links to other genomic resources and additional references. Updates to OMIM can be found on the update list or followed through the MIMmatch service. Updated user guides and tutorials are available on the website. As of September 2018, OMIM had over 24,600 entries, and the OMIM Morbid Map Scorecard had 6,259 molecularized phenotypes connected to 3,961 genes.}",

Reported TASs were common [median risk allele frequency 36\%, interquartile range (IQR) 21\%−53\%] and were associated with modest effect sizes [median odds ratio (OR) 1.33, IQR 1.20–1.61]. Among 20 genomic annotation sets, reported TASs were significantly overrepresented only in nonsynonymous sites [OR = 3.9 (2.2−7.0), p = 3.5 × 10−7] and 5kb-promoter regions [OR = 2.3 (1.5−3.6), p = 3 × 10−4] compared to SNPs randomly selected from genotyping arrays. Although 88\% of TASs were intronic (45\%) or intergenic (43\%), TASs were not overrepresented in introns and were significantly depleted in intergenic regions [OR = 0.44 (0.34−0.58), p = 2.0 × 10−9]. Only slightly more TASs than expected by chance were predicted to be in regions under positive selection [OR = 1.3 (0.8−2.1), p = 0.2]. This new online resource, together with bioinformatic predictions of the underlying functionality at trait/disease-associated loci, is well-suited to guide future investigations of the role of common variants in complex disease etiology.}}

However, much less attention was directed towards this task in Arabic, due to the lack of rich representative resources for training an Arabic text classifier. Therefore, we introduce a large Single-labeled Arabic News Articles Dataset (SANAD) of textual data collected from three news portals. The dataset is a large one consisting of almost 200k articles distributed into seven categories that we offer to the research community on Arabic computational linguistics. We anticipate that this rich dataset would make a great aid for a variety of NLP tasks on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) textual data, especially for single label text classification purposes. We present the data in raw form. SANAD is composed of three main datasets scraped from three news portals, which are AlKhaleej, AlArabiya, and Akhbarona.

Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",

               essential role in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Based on
               literature research, the classification of genetic mutations
               continues to be done manually nowadays. Manual classification of
               genetic mutations is pathologist-dependent, subjective, and
               time-consuming. To improve the accuracy of clinical
               interpretation, scientists have proposed computational-based
               approaches for automatic analysis of mutations with the advent
               of next-generation sequencing technologies. Nevertheless, some
               challenges, such as multiple classifications, the complexity of
               texts, redundant descriptions, and inconsistent interpretation,
               have limited the development of algorithms. To overcome these
               difficulties, we have adapted a deep learning method named
               Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)
               to classify genetic mutations based on text evidence from an
               annotated database. During the training, three challenging
               features such as the extreme length of texts, biased data
               presentation, and high repeatability were addressed. Finally,
               the BERT+abstract demonstrates satisfactory results with 0.80
               logarithmic loss, 0.6837 recall, and 0.705 F-measure. It is
               feasible for BERT to classify the genomic mutation text within
               literature-based datasets. Consequently, BERT is a practical
               tool for facilitating and significantly speeding up cancer
               research towards tumor progression, diagnosis, and the design of
               more precise and effective treatments.",

With the progress in natural language processing (NLP), extracting valuable information from biomedical literature has gained popularity among researchers, and deep learning has boosted the development of effective biomedical text mining models. However, directly applying the advancements in NLP to biomedical text mining often yields unsatisfactory results due to a word distribution shift from general domain corpora to biomedical corpora. In this article, we investigate how the recently introduced pre-trained language model BERT can be adapted for biomedical corpora.We introduce BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining), which is a domain-specific language representation model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical corpora. With almost the same architecture across tasks, BioBERT largely outperforms BERT and previous state-of-the-art models in a variety of biomedical text mining tasks when pre-trained on biomedical corpora. While BERT obtains performance comparable to that of previous state-of-the-art models, BioBERT significantly outperforms them on the following three representative biomedical text mining tasks: biomedical named entity recognition (0.62\\% F1 score improvement), biomedical relation extraction (2.80\\% F1 score improvement) and biomedical question answering (12.24\\% MRR improvement). Our analysis results show that pre-training BERT on biomedical corpora helps it to understand complex biomedical texts.We make the pre-trained weights of BioBERT freely available at https://github.com/naver/biobert-pretrained, and the source code for fine-tuning BioBERT available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert.}",

There is therefore a pressing need to assist biocuration with automated text mining tools. Here, we describe PubTator, a web-based system for assisting biocuration. PubTator is different from the few existing tools by featuring a PubMed-like interface, which many biocurators find familiar, and being equipped with multiple challenge-winning text mining algorithms to ensure the quality of its automatic results. Through a formal evaluation with two external user groups, PubTator was shown to be capable of improving both the efficiency and accuracy of manual curation. PubTator is publicly available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/Demo/PubTator/.}",

However, to realize its full potential to support these goals, several problems, such as fragmentation, heterogeneity, availability and different conceptualization of the data must be overcome. To provide the community with a resource free of these hurdles, we have developed DisGeNET (http://www.disgenet.org), one of the largest available collections of genes and variants involved in human diseases. DisGeNET integrates data from expert curated repositories, GWAS catalogues, animal models and the scientific literature. DisGeNET data are homogeneously annotated with controlled vocabularies and community-driven ontologies. Additionally, several original metrics are provided to assist the prioritization of genotype–phenotype relationships. The information is accessible through a web interface, a Cytoscape App, an RDF SPARQL endpoint, scripts in several programming languages and an R package. DisGeNET is a versatile platform that can be used for different research purposes including the investigation of the molecular underpinnings of specific human diseases and their comorbidities, the analysis of the properties of disease genes, the generation of hypothesis on drug therapeutic action and drug adverse effects, the validation of computationally predicted disease genes and the evaluation of text-mining methods performance.}",

Thanks to the exploration of genomic variants at large scale, hundreds of thousands of disease-associated loci have been uncovered. However, the identification of variants of clinical relevance is a significant challenge that requires comprehensive interrogation of previous knowledge and linkage to new experimental results. To assist in this complex task, we created DisGeNET (http://www.disgenet.org/), a knowledge management platform integrating and standardizing data about disease associated genes and variants from multiple sources, including the scientific literature. DisGeNET covers the full spectrum of human diseases as well as normal and abnormal traits. The current release covers more than 24 000 diseases and traits, 17 000 genes and 117 000 genomic variants. The latest developments of DisGeNET include new sources of data, novel data attributes and prioritization metrics, a redesigned web interface and recently launched APIs. Thanks to the data standardization, the combination of expert curated information with data automatically mined from the scientific literature, and a suite of tools for accessing its publicly available data, DisGeNET is an interoperable resource supporting a variety of applications in genomic medicine and drug R\\&amp;D.}",

               relationships between them. The new official website for OMIM,
               OMIM.org (http://omim.org), was launched in January 2011. OMIM
               is based on the published peer-reviewed biomedical literature
               and is used by overlapping and diverse communities of
               clinicians, molecular biologists and genome scientists, as well
               as by students and teachers of these disciplines. Genes and
               phenotypes are described in separate entries and are given
               unique, stable six-digit identifiers (MIM numbers). OMIM entries
               have a structured free-text format that provides the flexibility
               necessary to describe the complex and nuanced relationships
               between genes and genetic phenotypes in an efficient manner.
               OMIM also has a derivative table of genes and genetic
               phenotypes, the Morbid Map. OMIM.org has enhanced search
               capabilities such as genome coordinate searching and
               thesaurus-enhanced search term options. Phenotypic series have
               been created to facilitate viewing genetic heterogeneity of
               phenotypes. Clinical synopsis features are enhanced with UMLS,
               Human Phenotype Ontology and Elements of Morphology terms and
               image links. All OMIM data are available for FTP download and
               through an API. MIMmatch is a novel outreach feature to
               disseminate updates and encourage collaboration.",

              and proteins of human toxicologic significance. CTD will be the
              first publicly available database to a) provide annotated
              associations among genes, proteins, references, and toxic agents,
              with a focus on annotating data from aquatic and mammalian
              organisms; b) include nucleotide and protein sequences from
              diverse species; c) offer a range of analysis tools for
              customized comparative studies; and d) provide information to
              investigators on available molecular reagents. This combination
              of features will facilitate cross-species comparisons of
              toxicologically significant genes and proteins. These comparisons
              will promote understanding of molecular evolution, the
              significance of conserved sequences, the genetic basis of
              variable sensitivity to environmental agents, and the complex
